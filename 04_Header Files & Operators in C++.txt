# Header Files: 


* There are two types of header files: 

(i) System header files ---> They come with compiler 
e.g.: #incude<iostream>

(ii) User defined header files ---> These are written by programmer 
e.g.: #include "this.h" ---> There should be a file named "this.h" in the directory otherwise this line will give error 


* If you want to know details about any system header file then you can refer this website "en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header"

// Out of all the operators in C++, the scope resolution operator "::" has the highest precedence and comma operator "," has the least precedence 

// For checking precedence of other operators, you can refer this website:
