# Data Types: 


* Int, Float, Char, Double & Boolean these are called the primitive / built-in datatypes in C++ & these are some of the most used built-in datatypes of C++  

* By default a decimal literal is of "double" type 

* & to specify float we use 'f' or 'F' char after the decimal value 

* & to specify long double we use 'l' or 'L' char after the decimal value 


* Data types define the type of data a variable can hold 

** Data types can be of 3 types:
(i) Primitive / Built-in ---> Int, Float, Char, etc.
(ii) User-defined ---> Struct, Union, Enum, etc. 
(iii) Derived ---> Arrays, Functions, Pointers, etc.

# Some Commonly Used Operators & Manipulators Which were not Well Known to Me Before: 


:: ---> Scope resolution operator 
; ---> Terminator 
<< ---> Insertion Operator (Sends bytes to an output stream obejct) 
>> ---> Extraction Operator (Easiest way to get bytes from an input stream object) 
endl (end of line) & \n (escape sequence) ---> are used to start the new line

# Input & Output:


* cin & cout are two functions present in "iostream" header file, and they are used for taking inputs and printing outputs, respectively

* we use "Extraction" & "Insertion" operator with "cin" and "cout" respectively 

* Inside the "iostream" header file, specifially cin & cout are present in standard namespace, A.K.A "namespace std" 

* A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it.

* Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries

* even "endl" belongs to standard namespace, it is a manipulator, we just talked about it above
