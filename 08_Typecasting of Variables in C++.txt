# Typecasting of Variables:


* Changing the datatype of a variable to another datatype is called typecasting 

* Typecasting can be done in two ways: "automatically" by the compiler and "manually" by the programmer or user 

* Type Casting is also known as "Type Conversion"

# Code: 


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

    int a = 100;
    float b = 9.99;

    cout<<a+b<<endl;
    cout<<a+(int)b<<endl;           // This is the syntax of typecasting in C++
    cout<<a+int(b)<<endl;           // Typecating can be done like this also in C++ 

    return 0;
}
