# Enums: 


* "Enums" word is an abbrevation of word "Enumerations" 

* & the meaning of "Enumerations" is pretty simple, it just means "counting" or we can say "ordered listing of all the items in a collection" 

* So, Enums are user-defined types that consist of named integral constants 

* It helps to assign constants to a set of names to make the program easier to read, maintain and understand 

* An Enumeration is declared by using the keyword "enum" 


@ You can declare structures, unions & enums locally or globally, as per requirement.

# Example Code for Better Understanding Enums: 


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

enum Meal{
    Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner
};

// This above one is a global enum 

int main(){

    // enum Meal{Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner};                  // ---> You can declare enum inside the int main also 
    // This above one is a local enum 

    Meal m1 = Breakfast; 
    Meal m2 = Lunch; 
    Meal m3 = Dinner; 

    cout << "* The numerical value "<<"assigned to Breakfast is : " << m1 << endl;
 
    cout << "* The numerical value "<<"assigned to Lunch is : " << m2 << endl;

    cout << "* The numerical value "<<"assigned to Dinner is : " << m3 << endl;

    return 0;
}
