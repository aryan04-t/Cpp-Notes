# Object Oriented Programming in C++ (OOP): 


* OOPS ---> Object Oriented Programming System 

* OOP is just an approach to build programs & it just trys to eliminate the problems which are faced by conventional programming methods. 

* As we know that C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented features to C language. 

* As the size of the program increases, it's readability & maintainability decreases and also the bug-free nature of a program decreases. 

* So, OOP helps you to overcome these problems and it helps you to right much more optimal codes.

# Procedure Oriented Programming (POP): 


* POP consists of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow 

* Main focus is on functions and not on the flow of data 

* Fuctions can either use local or golbal data 

* Data moves openly from function to function, so data security is easily compromised 

* Until now whatever codes we have written in C++, all were procedure oriented programming based.

# OOP Introduction Continued...: 


* OOP works on the concept of classes and objects. 

* A class is a template to create objects. 

* OOP treats data as a critical element. 

* It decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around objects.
