# Hierarchical Inheritance in C++: 


* When more than one derived class is inherited from one base class then it's called Heirarchical Inheritance. 


# Understand this concept with this example and try to visualize it: 

* Example: We 4 classes "Employee", "Software_Developer", "Manager" & "Sales_Person" and out of these 4 classes, 3 classes are derived from only one base class "Employee", this type of inheritence is called "Hierarchical Inheritance" and this one is a good example of it.

# Example Code for Hierarchical Inheritance: 


#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;


// This is the base class 
class Employee{
    protected:
        int empId;
        string empName;
        int empSalary;
    public: 
        void setData(int a, string b, int c){
            empId = a;
            empName = b;
            empSalary = c;
        }
};


// This is the 1st derived class which has inherited the base class 
class Software_Developer : public Employee{
    public: 
        void getDeveloperInfo(void){
            cout << "* I am a developer and my employee Id is: " << empId << endl; 
            cout << "* My name is: " << empName << endl; 
            cout << "* And my salary is: " << empSalary << endl; 
            cout << endl; 
        }
};


// This is the 2nd derived class which has inherited the base class 
class Manager : public Employee{
    public: 
        void getManagerInfo(void){
            cout << "* I am a manager and my employee Id is: " << empId << endl; 
            cout << "* My name is: " << empName << endl; 
            cout << "* And my salary is: " << empSalary << endl; 
            cout << endl; 
        }
};


// This is the 3rd derived class which has inherited the base class 
class Sales_Person : public Employee{
    public: 
        void getSalesPersonInfo(void){
            cout << "* I am a sales person and my employee Id is: " << empId << endl; 
            cout << "* My name is: " << empName << endl; 
            cout << "* And my salary is: " << empSalary << endl; 
            cout << endl; 
        }
};


int main(){

    Software_Developer sde;
    sde.setData(10, "Aryan", 3000);

    Software_Developer senior_sde;
    senior_sde.setData(1, "Harry Bhaiya Dangerous Coder", 50000000);

    sde.getDeveloperInfo();

    Manager m;
    m.setData(2, "Dangerous Manager", 10000000);
    m.getManagerInfo();


    Sales_Person sp;
    sp.setData(3, "Kuch Bhi Bech Sakta Hun", 30000000);
    sp.getSalesPersonInfo();
